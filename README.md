SpamBuster is a lightweight, reliable, and easy-to-use security tool that scans your emails to identify spam. This tool is powered by a machine learning model behind the scenes which is hosted in the Google Cloud. This tool automatically scans the incoming emails as well as provides you with an option to manually scan the existing emails or folders. This tool comes in the form of an Outlook plug-in that can be used right from your Outlook Explorer window.
